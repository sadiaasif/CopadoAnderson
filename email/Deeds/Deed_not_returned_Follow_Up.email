Hello {!NullValue(Entities__c.client_name__c, "Sir or Madam")},

I wanted to follow up with you regarding the deed for the property located
at {!SUBSTITUTE(Entities__c.Name, "Deed -","")}, that we prepared for you. 

On {!Entities__c.Deed_Sent_To_Client__c}, we sent you the document which needed signatures and notary acknowledgement. To date, we have not received the signed deed back in our office. 

If you would like us to complete the transfer, please sign the document where flagged, and forward back to us in the envelope we provided so we can record with the appropriate county.

Thank you.
