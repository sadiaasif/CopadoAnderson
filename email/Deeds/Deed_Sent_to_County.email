Hello {!NullValue(Entities__c.client_name__c, "Sir or Madam")},

I wanted to let you know that the deed for the below mentioned property has been mailed to the county for recording, via tracking number: {!Entities__c.Tracking_Number_Deed_to_County__c}.

Property Address: {!SUBSTITUTE(Entities__c.Name, "Deed -","")}

We typically quote 6-8 weeks for recording. However, due to COVID-19 recording time frames vary from county to county.


Thank you.
