I am _______, an Accounting Coordinator with Anderson Advisors. My understanding is that you are interested in having our Tax Team review your personal tax returns that you have filed over the past 3 years to ensure you received all of the deductions you are entitled to. If necessary, we can work with the IRS to get you a refund - with interest! When you are ready to get scheduled for your 3-Year Tax review, please let me know and I&rsquo;d be happy to help get you on a Tax Advisor&rsquo;s calendar.</span></p>
