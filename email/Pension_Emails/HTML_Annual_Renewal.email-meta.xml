Dear %%first_name%%,

The Annual Plan Maintenance fee for your pension plan is due. If you would like Anderson to continue providing plan maintenance, you must complete and return this Administrative Service Declaration by August 31, 2019.

Annual Plan Maintenance - $350
Click here to remit payment securely online.

Annual Plan Maintenance includes maintenance of the qualified document status of the pension plan under IRS guidelines for plan compliance requirements. This includes notification and delivery of any model amendment changes to the plan documents. We will also notify you at the time the IRS requires any plan restatement requirements.

If you elect not to have Anderson provide your Annual Plan Maintenance, we cannot guarantee your plan will remain compliant within IRS guidelines. Important communication regarding required Department of Labor or IRS changes to the plan documents will not be forwarded. Further, if you elect not to use Anderson for your Annual Plan Maintenance, we strongly encourage you to work with another plan provider to keep your plan compliant.

Please contact us if you do not intend on using the plan. A pension plan does not just cease to exist; it must be canceled or terminated with the IRS per their guidelines. If not closed properly, penalties may be assessed.

If you have any questions, please contact Bob Wilkinson at bwilkinson@andersonadvisors.com or 253-981-6004
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. For your convenience, you may RENEW ONLINE. Continue reading below for a list of ancillary services that may be required in the future.

Sincerely,
Anderson Business Advisors
