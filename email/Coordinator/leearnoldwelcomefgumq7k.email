{!Contact.FirstName},<br><br>Thank you for the time today to go over setting up your Corporation and working with us here at Anderson. As I stated on the call, my contact information is below, and here is a recap of what we discussed:<br><br>I'm your Client Services Representative. If you have questions, need updates or have concerns at any time, please don't hesitate to email or call me! I will do my best to respond within 1-2 business days (if not sooner) if I'm away from my desk when you reach out.<br><br>Please note that I'd like to confirm in writing your chosen names for your company, and the company's address. If I do not hear back from you with any corrections within 24 hours, we will move forward with preparing your filing:<br><br>[CORP NAME 1]<br>[CORP NAME 2]<br><br>I'll send everything out to our processing department to file with the Secretary of State in the next few days. The time frame depends on the State's office and how high of a volume of filings they're processing at that time. This can be done same day in a few states, up to several weeks for others.<br><br>You'll receive your Corporate binder in the mail 7-10 days after we send everything off to the State for filing. A second package will be shipped to you afterwards with your Secretary of State documents and the Corporate binder's nameplate.<br><br>We will ship both packages the mailing address you verified:<br>{!Account.ShippingAddress}<br><br>The Employer Identification Number (EIN) will also be applied for with the IRS. You'll receive a separate email from me via Docusign. Please open the email, click the link, and digitally sign where indicated.<br><br>Once everything is completed, I'll reach out to you with a link to access your online Binder Review video, which will walk you through your binder documents with you.<br><br>Thank you again for the opportunity to work with you!
