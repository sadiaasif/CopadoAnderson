{!Contact.FirstName},<br><br>Thank you for choosing Anderson Business Advisors!<br><br>My name is {!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName} and I’m your designated Coordinator that will personally oversee your account. My role is to assist your Advisor in making sure everything we are structuring for you is completed to your satisfaction. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime. I outlined a few important steps in the process below for your reference. <br><br>#1 - STARTING OUT<br>To complete your structures we need to confirm a few items such as the names you want for the entities. I will be speaking with you by phone to confirm the information, if not already. I’ll follow up with an email that will include the spelling and particulars of your structures. It’s important that you review the information quickly, as we start the process of filing your entities right away to make sure you have everything in a timely manner. <br><br>Note: Any changes made to the confirmed information after we have started the process of forming your entity(s) may be subject to additional charges. You may have received a “Questionnaire” to fill out to gather the information, if so please forward those to me or call to help fill them out.<br><br>Also attached is an authorization and SS4 form for you to sign that will allow us to obtain your EIN from the IRS on your behalf. Please fill out the authorization form, however, you are not required to fill out the SS4. Please sign this form only - DO NOT date it.<br><br>#2 - FILING FEES<br>As a reminder, the state filing fees are charged separately. Once your entity is ready to be filed with the state, the associated filing fees will be charged to the credit card on file. <br><br>Note: Please let me know if you would like to be notified before your credit card is charged.<br><br>#3 - ANDERSON SYSTEM BINDER<br>An Anderson System Binder will be shipped to you. The Anderson System Binder will explain in greater detail who we are and our system of success. One of our Advisors will be assigned to you to walk through the process of the Anderson System once we get your entities filed. <br><br>#4 - SHIPPING YOUR ENTITY BINDER(S)<br>Once your entity(s) is formed and ready to be shipped, we will send it to the address included in your agreement; {!Account.ShippingStreet} {!Account.ShippingCity}, {!Account.ShippingState} {!Account.ShippingPostalCode} {!Account.ShippingCountry}, unless you indicate otherwise. <br><br>VERY IMPORTANT: Please note that in many states we ship the entity binder and the official Articles of Formation from the state separately. When you get your binder please call me to verify that your entity name has been approved by the state prior to setting up any bank accounts or ordering materials with the name. <br><br>#5 - YOUR DOCUMENTS ONLINE <br>For easy access and use for you, we store all your documents in our online secure portal at Box.com You should have received an invitation to join Box.com.
