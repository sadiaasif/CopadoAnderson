    <textOnly>Hello {!Entities__c.AccName__c},

I hope you are doing well!

I see that you have received your binder, and I&apos;m reaching out to make sure that you have gone through all of your entity&apos;s paperwork.

If you have not done so, please make sure to complete the following items:

1. READ YOUR INTRODUCTION LETTER. Depending on what state you&apos;ve filed in and how your entity is set up, there may be forms that need to be signed and returned before a certain date. These items are usually outlined in this letter along with a few more key pieces of information.

2. WATCH THE BINDER REVIEW VIDEO. This will walk you through the tabs in your binder so you know where everything is located and what it is. Binder Review Video:

3. SIGN WHERE ALL THE SIGNATURE TABS ARE LOCATED. The signature tabs denote where you must sign to make these documents legal and binding. The person whose name is on the signature line MUST be the one to sign, one party may not sign for another in their absence. Note: As with any legal document, please read everything you sign.

4. READ THROUGH YOUR OPERATING AGREEMENT. Your Operating Agreement, in essence, the rules and procedures for your company. If you go through them in conjunction with the corresponding binder review video it will explain what each article covers. It is important that you have an understanding of these rules, provisions, and procedures. If you do not adhere to them or act outside of the scope of what they allow you could end up inadvertently piercing your corporate veil.

5. SCHEDULE A 1-ON-1 REVIEW (OPTIONAL). If you require additional explanation of the items contained in your binder and/or outlined in your By-Laws, please use the link at the end of the binder review video or below to schedule a one on one binder review with one of our Tax Advisors. They will be able to answer the more detailed questions you may have. Binder Review: https://calendly.com/aba-tax-advisors

6. OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT. Your business should now start to flow through your LLC instead of your personal name and money should come from the LLC bank account.

If you need any assistance after you&apos;ve viewed the video, please let your Law Coordinator know and they are more than happy to help!


Thank you,
