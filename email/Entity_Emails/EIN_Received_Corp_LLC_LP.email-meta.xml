    <textOnly>Dear {!Entities__c.AccName__c},

We have received the Employer Identification Number (EIN) for {!Entities__c.Name}.

EIN: {!Entities__c.EIN__c}
Tax Year End Date: {!Entities__c.Year_End__c}

The organization will be treated as a {!Entities__c.Tax_Status__c} for federal income tax purposes. As a {!Entities__c.Tax_Status__c}, your organization will file tax form {!Entities__c.Tax_Form__c} every year.

The EIN is the tax reporting number under which you will pay your taxes. It is also very important for opening a bank account* and conducting business in general.

A copy of your EIN application is included with your entity documents in Box or your Platinum Portal.

*Please do not attempt to open your entity bank account now. You will be able to do this once your documents are complete.

Platinum Members:
Log into your Platinum Portal to see real-time status of your new company via the Entity Tracker.


Thank you,
Anderson Business Advisors, LLC</textOnly>
