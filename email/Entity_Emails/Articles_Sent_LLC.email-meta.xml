    <textOnly>Dear {!Entities__c.AccName},

We have sent the Articles of Organization for {!Entities__c.Name} to the Secretary of State of {!Entities__c.Organization_State__c}. This is the beginning of the entity formation process.

Many states approve and return documents within one to two weeks, but some states may take longer. We will notify you when our office receives the filed documents.

Platinum members may log into the Platinum Portal to view the Entity Tracker. This is a visual tool that lets you know where we are in the entity creation process.

If you&apos;re not a Platinum member, learn more at: https://andersonadvisors.com/platinum-membership-2/

Or, contact your Law Coordinator for more information.

Thank you,
