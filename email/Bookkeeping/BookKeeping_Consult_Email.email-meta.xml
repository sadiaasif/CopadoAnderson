If you are doing any type of bookkeeping at the moment, please let us know at the time of your consultation
We will discuss how to transfer that information over to our software for us to proceed with your bookkeeping

Any package(s) you have purchased to be used for bookkeeping services
Note: If you purchased units, we can use them for bookkeeping for the time being. We are moving away from those units and packages for bookkeeping across the board.
Purchasing a package does not automatically get you set up with bookkeeping services.

Any questions you have regarding your bookkeeping

By scheduling a consultation, you are stating you agree to our Terms &amp; Conditions. Once your consultation is scheduled, our onboarding team will reach out to you on the date and time that you choose. Please provide us the phone number you can be reached at.

Please keep in mind that if you need to cancel or reschedule, you should give at least 48 hours notice as there are many other clients interested in bookkeeping services that we need to schedule calls with. Should you fail to keep that appointment without prior notice, you will be placed at the end of the queue and will need to reschedule.

We will discuss our services, pricing, software options and any other questions you have at the time of our consultation. If you have any questions in the meantime, please reach out to bookkeepingadmins@andersonadvisors.com.

Best Regards,
