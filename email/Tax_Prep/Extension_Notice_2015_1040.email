Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope this email finds you well. My name is {!User.Name} and I am emailing you today regarding the filing of your 2015 1040 tax return. As an update, an extension has been filed on your behalf. 

Please be advised that an extension does not extend your time to pay any additional tax liability due. If you believe you are going to owe any additional taxes, a payment will need to be made prior to April 15th. If a payment is not made by April 15th you may incur a late payment penalty of 1/2 of 1% of the unpaid tax. 
 
We are working to complete your return as soon as possible and will be in touch, should we need any additional information to that end. Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional assistance in the meantime.
