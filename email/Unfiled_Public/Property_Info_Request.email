I received your land trust and deed questionnaires.

Before I can draft the land trust and deed documents I will need you to send me a copy of the last filed deed and a copy of the last county property tax statement for the property. 

The deed is usually titled as "Warranty Deed" or "Quit Claim Deed" (or Grant Deed in California) and is the document you would have received when you took title of the property. If the deed references an Exhibit A please make sure the Exhibit A is attached.

Please do not send a copy of the Deed of Trust as it is only a mortgage document that you would have received if there is a loan on the property.

Please contact me with any questions.
