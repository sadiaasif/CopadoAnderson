Hello ______,

I am emailing you to follow up on the tax package that you purchased. The tax package you purchased includes a 2 Year Tax Review and a ____ preparation. If you would like to take advantage of these services, I will need your past 2 years of tax returns and a tax organizer returned back from you at your earliest convenience. Once I receive your tax returns, I will be able to schedule the review with a CPA. I can provide the tax organizer to you when you are ready, but please be advised your return is due by ____ and we recommend you send it in 4 weeks prior.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me!
