{!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to reach out to you as a reminder that you have a past due invoice for one or more of your business entities. I tried contacting you by phone but was unable to reach you. 

Our records indicate that the annual renewal has not been paid and, as such, has not been renewed with the Secretary of State. Your annual renewals must be kept current with the Secretary of State in order to remain in compliance. 

Please reach out to me as soon as possible so I can assist you in making sure that your renewal is taken care of quickly to avoid any further state imposed late fees. You can reach me at 800-706-4741 ext {!User.Extension} or by email at {!User.Email}. 

Thank you in advance for your prompt response.
